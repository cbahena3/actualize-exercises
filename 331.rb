# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.
# Create an array to store names of 3 different countries.
# Then add one more country and print the array one line.
countries = ["USA", "Canada", "Mexico"]
countries.push("Germany")
pp countries


# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.
# It was easy to solve from memory, I will practice more in depth arrays and hashes
