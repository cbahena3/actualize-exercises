# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.

#Start with an array of numbers and create a new array with each number times 3.
#For example, [1, 2, 3] becomes [3, 6, 9].
arrayOne = [10, 20, 30]
arrayTwo = []
index = 0
while index < arrayOne.length
    arrayTwo.push(arrayOne[index] * 3)
    index = index + 1
end
pp arrayTwo

# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.
# at first I had trouble because I was not sure how to
# make the loop add the numbers to my second array
# I need more practice on methods.
