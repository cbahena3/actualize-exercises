# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.

#1. Write a program that uses a variable to store a number,
#then prints that number plus 10.

bob = 215
puts bob + 10

# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.

#I was able to easily solve this from memory.
#I will try a few more variable exercises first
#and tomorrow move onto conditionals.
