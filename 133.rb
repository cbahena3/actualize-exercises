# QUESTION 1
# Write a program that uses a while loop to print the numbers from 1 to 20.
# If the number is 7 or 15, it should also print out "Hey, that's my lucky number!"

number = 1
while number <= 20
    if number == 7 || number == 15
            puts 'Hey, that\'s my lucky number!'
        else
            puts number
    end
 number = number + 1
end


# QUESTION 2
# Finish annotating the code below.
# Then run the code to see if the output matches your annotation.

number = 0             # 1
while 2 > number       # 2 6 9
  if number < 1        # 3 7
    puts number        # 4
  end
  number = number + 1  # 5 8
end
puts "Done!"           # 10

# 1: number is 0
# 2: (2 is greater than 0, continue)
# 3: 3 is less than 1, continue
# 4: prints 0
# 5: number becomes 1
# 6: 2 is greater than 1, continue
# 7: 1 is not less than one, end
# 8: number becomes 2
# 9: 2 is not less than 2, end
# 10: prints 'Done!'
