# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.
#Write a while loop that prints the word "hello" 5 times.
number = 0
while number < 5
    puts "hello"
    number = number + 1
end

# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.

# At first I was thinking maybe I needed to multiply a string
# then I remembered I can set number = 0 and do a counting method to print hello
# I will practice harder loops.
