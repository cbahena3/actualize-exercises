# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.
# Write a method that takes in a number and returns the number times two. 
# Then run the method and print the result.
def double(number)
    return number * 2
end
puts double(100)


# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.
# I did not find it hard I just realized I forgot the parameters 
# I need to practice more with custom methods to remember all thats needed
