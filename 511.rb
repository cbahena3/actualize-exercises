# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.

# Make a hash to store a person's first name, last name, and email address.
# Then print each attribute on separate lines.
myInfo = {firstName: "Cristian", lastName: "Bahena", email: "user@gmail.com"}
puts myInfo[:firstName]
puts myInfo[:lastName]
puts myInfo[:email]

# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.
# this exercise was easy. I just had misread it and thought it wanted me to create a program
# that allows for a user to input their data. I will continue to practice more challenging hashes.
