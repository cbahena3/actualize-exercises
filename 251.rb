# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.
# Create an array to store 3 words. 
# Then add two more words to the array and print the array on one line.
myArray = ["Banana", "Apple", "Orange"]
pp myArray
myArray.push("Mango", "Pineapple")
pp myArray


# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.
# I was able to solve it pretty easy, I will practice harder array problems.
