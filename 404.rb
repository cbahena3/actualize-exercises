# QUESTION 1

# 1) I will be choosing schedule "Version 4 - Daytime Daily Habits Sprint"
# 2) I believe this will work best for me because I only have a part-time job right now.
# I also want to work on building projects to better my programming. Dedicating a good amount
# of time to algorithms and deliberate practice is also something I want to do. And of course
# applications and networking is important as well.
