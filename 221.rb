# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.
#Write a while loop to print the numbers 1 through 10.
number = 1
while number <= 10
    puts number
    number = number + 1
end
# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.

#I was able to easily solve it from memory so tomorrow I will work on 
#different questins related to loops.
