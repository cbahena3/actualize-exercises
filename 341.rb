# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.
# Write a method that takes in two numbers and
# returns the first number subtracted by the second.
# Then run the method and print the result.
def theNums(first, second)
  return first - second
end
puts theNums(10, 3)

# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.
# I was able to piece the answer together from memory.
# I will take on harder custom methods.
