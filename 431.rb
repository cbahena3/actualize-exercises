# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.
# Start with an array of numbers and compute the sum of all the numbers.
# For example, [5, 10, 8, 3] becomes 26
array = [100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700]
index = 0
total = 0
while index < array.length
  total = total + array[index]
index = index + 1
end
puts total




# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.
#It was not difficult but I did not do the each or reduce methods which would
#make it shorter. I will practice more loops to figure out quicker ways to code
