# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.

# Make an array of hashes to store the title and author for 3 different books.
# Then print out the third book's author.
books = [
  {"Dog Days" => "Jeff Kinney"},
  {"The Hunger Games" => "Suzanne Collins"},
  {"The Wolf of Wall Street" => "Jordan Belfort"}
]
puts books [2]["The Wolf of Wall Street"]

# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.

# Overall I thought it was a simple exercise but I will continue to practice hard ones.
