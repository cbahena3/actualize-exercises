            <p>My name is Cristian Bahena and I am 22 years old. 
            I have an Associate of Arts Degree from the College of Lake County.
            <br>Before I began programming I was interested in pursing a degree in Marketing since I had always done sales in the past.
            <br>After I received my Associates Degree I realized I wanted to become a software engineer. I began my journey with

            <p>I decided not to pursue my Bachelors Degree in <em>Marketing</em> after I saw my brother become a software engineer.
            <br>He graduated from Actualize about a year or two ago and realized he got the same outcome as those that got a 4 year degree.
            <br>He was the one that got me into programming and  made me realized it was something I enjoyed. Shortly after I decided to pursue a similar path!

            <p>After my degree I tried school for a little while longer and realized they made it so hard to learn coding in school.
            <br>I decided to teach myself by using <strong>Codecademy</strong>. Through the resources they provided I found it easy to learn code.
            <br> I once felt that I would never understand it but a few months later I now have a certification on the basics of <em>HTML, CSS, Python, and JavaScript.</em>
