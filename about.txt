My name is Cristian Bahena and I am 22 years old. 
Back in 2022 I received my Associate of Arts degree from the College of Lake County. 
I had originally planned on studying Marketing/Finance but decided I wanted to purse a degree in computer science.
I attended DePaul University for a semester to see how I liked their program for Computer Science and did enjoy it.
However, I decided to take this bootcamp instead since my brother had taken it and saw success from it.
I am very excited to learn more and become a great software developer.
